# Prrr
Pull Request Review Requestor, Or "Prrr"

We're adding the same people all of the time (depends on repo), why do it manually?

How to use:
1. Download
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run build`
4. Go to "Chrome extensions" and choose "load unpacked", choose the `/build` folder
5. Click on the extension in the chrome bar to open the edit page, fill it with repos and users
6. open a new pull request in one of the repos your entered
7. open the `add reviewers` on github and click on the text input, it should add your reviewers in on (and only on) the first click
